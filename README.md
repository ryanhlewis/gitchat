![header](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d95aea95-daf1-4394-967f-52b26e4a46ce)

gitchat is a chat application that lets you control your chat by keeping it all contained within git.

you can delete your git repo (chat history) at any time, store it somewhere else, edit it as needed, or back it up
as easily as you do with your typical git repositories. gitchat is private and secure to your own git instances.

We add some integration with the largest provider of git-based services, GitHub, allowing you to search through
available profiles to add friends, start chats (by automatically inviting collaborators), and delete chats.
